# floppy-penguin

Floppy Bird is a game I created in Pygame / Python 2.7. 

It is an object-oriented platformer game in which the player's objective is to pass each level by eating all the fish. 

To play the game, download the file, unzip it, and ensure that all files are in the folder. Run "Floppy Penguin.py" to play the game.

Ensure that you have Pygame installed and that you are running the program on Python 2.7.
