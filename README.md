# Floppy Penguin

Floppy Bird is a game I created in Pygame / Python 2.7. 

I created a simple level-based game for fun! As a penguin, your goal is to pass each level by catching all the fish before they swim away. You must not swim outside the screen boundaries, or else you'll die. The most challenging part of creating this game was coding realistic physics from scratch. 

Be sure to have Python and Pygame installed if you want to try the game out. After downloading the repository, simply open "Floppy Penguin.py" in the IDLE editor and hit Run Module (F5) to play. I hope you enjoy!


Notes:
Ensure that you have Pygame installed and that you are running the program on Python 2.7.
